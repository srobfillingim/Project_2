roadTrip 66 is a website application meant to give users a quick and easy way to plan a road trip along the Route 66. This site connects travelers to each other by providing and experiencing similar vacations.

By filling out our roadTrip form, travelers can desribe their own personal vacations, allowing other travelers to enjoy the same experience. The form consists of the traveling location, activities done, rest stops stayed at, and more!

With those forms filled out, other users can search our site for vacations according to location, activities, and other things specified on the form!

Our site includes the use of handlebars, javascript, mysql, materialize, and travis.
